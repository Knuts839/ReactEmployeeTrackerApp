This employee directory app was made using react. THe buisness case for this application is that it allows the employer to keep track of his employees. It also uses the axios and react dom to api calls and to render various components of my web page dynamically. React is a great tool it allows the web developer to not have to re-render his page each time a user of the page clcks on something new. React allows the various pieces of your web page to act independently of eachother. The challanges of this project learning react and applying it to time sensitive deadline at the same time. The successes I feel I was able to accomplish this farely well. I had some deployment heartles with Heroku and my browser saying they could not render files. It turnes out that the warnings I was getting in my browser was actually an error preventing my program from working. I had my file names camelcase for react and google chrome my browser requires PascalCasing of the file name to render.
This project went farely well even the new react stuff the css and to lesser extent jsx which is like html felt like I did before. Only one super time consuming bug where I had file name that was a integrated java script function call which through everything off but I figured that out. I look forward to after project 3 and the bootcamp devoting more time to learning more about react.
